# Impact of Economic Indicators on Stock Market Performance: A Panel Data Analysis

## Project Overview
This project analyzes the impact of economic indicators on stock market performance in simulated countries A and B. I focused on synthetic data that includes data generation, merging datasets, cleaning and preprocessing data, and conducting regression and panel data analysis using STATA.

## Contents
- **data/**: Contains the generated datasets.
- **code/**: Includes the STATA script for data generation, merging, cleaning, and analysis.
- **results/**: Contains the output files and visualizations.
- **paper/**: Includes the research paper.

## How to Run the Analysis
1. Load the data in STATA.
2. Run the `analysis.do` script to generate, merge, clean, and analyze the data.
3. Review the results in the `results/` folder.

## Key Findings
- Regression analysis shows significant relationships between economic indicators and stock market returns.
- Panel data analysis reveals the importance of considering both fixed and random effects models to understand these relationships better.

The scatter plot highlights the relationship between GDP growth and stock returns for both countries. We observe that country B performs averagely much higher than country A.

### Average Stock Returns by Country

The bar plot compares the average stock returns between CountryA and CountryB. It is clear that country B has a higher average stock return compared to the countryB.

### Distribution of Inflation Rates

The histogram shows the distribution of inflation rates for both countries. From the plot, we can see that the country B has a higher stock market capitalization which results in a higher average returns compared to country A.
